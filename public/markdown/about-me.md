# About Me

## Biography

Hey there! I am self taught developer with a year of experience. I have certificates from Scrimba and Coursera.

I'm trying to find a balance between research and engineering.

My current research interests lie primarily in understanding and improving continuity, generalizability, efficiency and other key properties in frontend frameworks. I'm also interested in learning and expanding into backend frameworks and how everything operates.
